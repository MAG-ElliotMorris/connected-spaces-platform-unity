/*
 * This deals with generating glue that converts the director callback pattern into async/await that's natural to use in C#.
 * As we don't want to write several methods of boilerplate for each method, we abuse macros.
 * This is the only part of the prototype that I do not fully know how I would eliminate the need for manual wrapping effort, given enough time.
 * Perhaps you could symbol dump the .dll, figure out all the callback symbols, build a .txt file and run jinja with that as an input?
 *
 * If any of this sort of stuff becomes a significant effort, you may want to consider
 * a very small jinja2 step to preprocess some of your SWIG input files instead of this
 * undignified macrolarkey.

/* 
 * Generic macros to stamp two things:
 * 1. An extension of the C++ callback type (from within C#) that overrides its `Call` function, and dispatches to an injected Action.
 * 2. An extension of the C# class that uses the callback type to create an awaitable member function.
 * The extension of the callback type is the magic that lets C++ call C# functions, it uses SWIGs director feature.
 * For #2, it's possible just packaging strait up C# extension methods may be more desirable, yet to be seen where the line is around stuff like this.
 * TODO: Extending this to something that can handle multiple callback arguments will be something that needs doing.
 * Params with types and params without types ... gross. There's probably a nicer way to do this.
