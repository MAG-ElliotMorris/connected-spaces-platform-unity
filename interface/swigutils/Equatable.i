/* Implement the IEquatable interface on compatible types.
 * This interface wants 3 things
 * - Equals(Class)
 * - Equals(Object)
 * - GetHashCode()
 *
 * For the equals operators, declaring something equatable means it is comparable,
 * which we define to mean that the C++ type has operator ==, and has a std::hash implementation.
 * If both of these things are not true, the type cannot be equatable, and is probably
 * not a "value type". CSP does need to do work to make this true, don't just necessarily
 * accept that the underlying objects value category is correct, you may need to cajole people to add
 * some operators into CSP ... or do it yourself.
 *
 * This interface makes value equality work in C#, so Obj1 and Obj2 will be equal
 * if they have the same data. It also allows container types to function more
 * optimally.
 *
 * You may be wondering why we're implementing GetHashCode, since it's not on the
 * IEquatable interface. That is because there is a contract between Equals and
 * GetHashCode, in that if two objects are equal according to Equals, they must
 * also be equal according to GetHashCode. Leaving the System.base reference equality
 * implementation would violate this contract.
 *
 * This also registers the enhanced form of List<T>, as these types are equatable
 * so can support it, although you will still need to declare the template for
 * this list for this to have any effect, otherwise the type isn't generated at all.
